# nonArmingtonCarbonPolicy
A non-Armington trade model to simulate carbon pricing and trade policy.

The code is all written in Fortran. There are two data files that are also included that serve as inputs to the program: input.txt and transport.txt.

I cannot host an executable on my website, so email me if you would like the executable file at: kcastellanos1@gsu.edu

More information on the model used here is available at my website: sites.gsu.edu/kcastellanos1
